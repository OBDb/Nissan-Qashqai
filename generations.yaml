    description: "The original Nissan Qashqai (pronounced 'kash-kye' and marketed as the Dualis in Japan and Australia) pioneered the compact crossover segment in Europe, combining SUV styling cues with hatchback dimensions and driving dynamics. Built on Nissan's C platform shared with the X-Trail, it featured a relatively high seating position and available all-wheel drive while maintaining car-like handling characteristics. The exterior design blended smooth curves with subtle SUV elements including black lower body cladding and increased ground clearance compared to conventional hatchbacks. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 1.6L and 2.0L gasoline engines and 1.5L and 2.0L diesel options, paired with manual or CVT transmissions. The interior emphasized practicality with flexible seating configurations, good visibility, and straightforward controls. A seven-seat variant called the Qashqai+2 was introduced in 2008, featuring an extended wheelbase and rear overhang to accommodate the additional row. A significant refresh in 2010 brought updated styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced technology features. The first-generation Qashqai proved tremendously successful, particularly in Europe, establishing a new vehicle category that combined the appeal of an SUV with the efficiency and driving dynamics of a conventional hatchback."

    description: "The second-generation Qashqai featured more sophisticated styling with sharper lines, a more pronounced V-motion grille, and LED lighting elements. Built on the Renault-Nissan Alliance CMF-CD platform, it grew slightly in size while reducing weight through increased use of high-strength steel and aluminum components. Powertrain options continued with improved versions of the 1.2L, 1.3L, 1.6L and 2.0L gasoline engines and 1.5L, 1.6L and 1.7L diesel engines in most markets, with efficiency enhancements including start-stop technology. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual, an improved Xtronic CVT, and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available on select variants. The interior represented a significant upgrade with higher quality materials, improved design, and enhanced technology including an available 7-inch NissanConnect touchscreen infotainment system, Around View Monitor, and an expanding suite of driver assistance features eventually encompassing autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and traffic sign recognition. The seven-seat +2 variant was discontinued with that role taken by the larger X-Trail/Rogue. A significant update in 2017 brought revised exterior styling, interior refinements, and the addition of ProPILOT semi-autonomous driving capability on higher trims. In North America, this generation was marketed as the Nissan Rogue Sport from 2017 to 2022. The second-generation Qashqai continued the model's strong sales success, particularly in Europe where it frequently ranked among the bestselling vehicles overall, not just in the crossover segment it helped establish."

    description: "The current Qashqai features a more dramatic evolution of Nissan's design language with a bold interpretation of the V-motion grille, slim LED headlights, floating roof effect, and more muscular proportions. Built on an updated version of the CMF-CD platform with increased use of lightweight materials, it offers improved rigidity and refinement. For the first time, the Qashqai has fully embraced electrification, with European models featuring either the innovative e-Power system (where a gasoline engine functions solely as a generator for an electric motor that drives the wheels) or mild hybrid technology paired with a 1.3L turbocharged gasoline engine. Traditional diesel engines have been eliminated from the lineup. The interior represents a substantial upgrade with higher quality materials throughout, a more contemporary design, and significantly enhanced technology including an available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 9-inch central touchscreen with wireless Google services, and a 10.8-inch head-up display. Safety technology has expanded with an improved Around View Monitor featuring a 200-degree front camera and enhanced semi-autonomous driving capabilities via ProPILOT Assist. A facelift introduced in 2024 brought redesigned headlights and taillights, a new front fascia, new alloy wheels, and the addition of Google built-in services to the infotainment system. Practicality remains a focus with increased passenger and cargo space, though the model maintains its compact exterior dimensions. Globally, the Qashqai uses the Qashqai name in all markets, with production established in the United Kingdom and later in China starting May 2023, representing Nissan's continued commitment to the compact crossover segment it pioneered."
